_Original title: "Преступление и наказание". First published in 1866. I read the Finnish translation "Rikos ja rangaistus" by J.A. Hollo from 1922._

Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov, a poor student living in St Petersburg, commits a crime. The motive is not immediately evident to the reader and the offender is hesitant about it. What begins as a thought experiment progresses to preparations supposedly without intention and soon somehow starts to feel inevitable. At a point, Raskolnikov notices it's too late to turn back.

Does he do it for personal gain? Is it an act of passion? Is Raskolnikov mentally ill? Is it incited by his miserable circumstances? As in life generally, there seem to be multiple perspectives to it. 

One of those is certainly his self-formed ideology. Despite Raskolnikov's notable compassion (showing through his care not only for his mother and sister but even for total strangers) he believes ends justify means for exceptional people: their conscience can excuse some bloodshed if it's required to advance the humanity. Raskolnikov is confident he's special and could do a lot of good in his life if he would just have the opportunity. He tells himself the benefits of the crime would surely outweigh the unpleasant deed eventually. Unsettlingly, the criminal doesn't appear to be quite clear on how he would contribute to the world.

Next, feeling disgusted by what he has done, Raskolnikov doesn't follow through the rest of his plan. But the act can't be undone anymore. It's a lot to handle emotionally and the delirium, paranoia, and volatility make it harder to hide the secret. Raskolnikov takes his inability to proceed with the undertaking as a demonstration of not being an extraordinary person after all.

The protagonist is now in existential crisis. His beliefs have left him with wounded dignity and nothing to live for. If Raskolnikov would be able to change those beliefs, he could feel the pains of guilt and remorse for the victims. He'd prefer that to meaninglessness.

>"Mere existence had always been too little for him; he had always wanted more. Perhaps it was just because of the strength of his desires that he had thought himself a man to whom more was permissible than to others."

The thought of mere existence without purpose is unsettling. Rejecting religion, where does Raskolnikov find meaning? After dismissing God and metaphysical explanations, one might have conflicting beliefs and be painfully aware or ruinously unaware of them. Ideologies are not always adopted consciously and not all of them are that different from religions. After all, Raskolnikov's desperate desire for meaning leads to radicalism as detrimental as religious fundamentalism.
